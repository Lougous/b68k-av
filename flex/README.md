The latest Quartus version that supports FLEX devices is 9.0 SP2. Not available for download on intel servers any more, here is a link to archive.org:

On linux, depending on distribution/version the use with wine is uncertain ... sometimes quartus can install and run properly, sometimes intall freezes at final stage and GUI cannot run. So far compilation is still possible with command line - see flow.sh script
